# Dollar General – Competitive Intelligence Report

**Prepared for:** Executive Leadership & Investor Relations  
**Date:** 15 Nov 2025

---

## Executive Summary
Dollar General has cemented itself as the largest U.S. discount‑retailer, with FY 2023 revenue of $37.9 B and a stable 6.3 % operating margin. Growth is driven by aggressive store‑upgrade programs (“Project Elevate/Project Renovate”), a rapid rollout of the DG Market format that expands grocery offerings, and an early‑adoption AI merchandising platform announced in late 2025. While the firm enjoys a robust liquidity cushion (cash > $10 B, debt‑to‑equity 0.75), customer sentiment remains mixed – high value is praised, but pricing inflation, product quality and store operations generate frequent complaints. The key strategic opportunity lies in leveraging AI and digital capabilities to deepen grocery penetration, improve inventory efficiency, and enhance the customer experience, while mitigating reputation risk through targeted quality‑control and service‑level initiatives.

## Product Strategy & Competitive Positioning

| Format | Size | Key Features | Value Proposition |
|--------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Dollar General** | ~7,300 sq ft | Core discount goods | 99¢ staples + 20‑30 % cheaper private‑label goods |
| **DG Market** | ~16,000 sq ft | Fresh produce, meats, dairy, frozen | 10‑15 % above dollar‑store prices, still < traditional grocery |
| **DG X** | ~4,000 sq ft | Urban, high‑density | Curated assortment for quick‑grab |
| **Popshelf** | Premium | Upscale private‑label | Higher‑margin, premium positioning |

**Private‑Label Portfolio** – DG Brands include Clover Valley (groceries), Good & Smart (health foods), Smart & Simple (household paper), Studio Selection (personal care), Comfort Bay (bath & linens), Gentle Steps (diapers), DG Health (OTC), True Living (housewares), and DG Home (decor)【12】【13】. 120+ new private‑brand launches in 2025, focusing on groceries and health‑beauty【13】.
